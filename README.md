# fwd-back package

Keep track of where your cursor has been in the buffer, and move back and forth between them!

Useful for when you jump to a symbol and want to quickly get back to where you were, or any other situation where you're jumping back and forth between different parts of a file.

- cmd-ctrl-left -> back
- cmd-ctrl-right -> fwd
